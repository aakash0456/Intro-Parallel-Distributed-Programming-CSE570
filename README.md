Sorting_Small_Integers_MPI
Implemented an efficient algorithm to sort small integers in distributed memory using Intel MPI without using all-to-all, gather and send-receive operations.
This code was tested and benchmarked on UB's HPC center, Center for Computational Research.



Connected_Components_Trees_MapReduce
Efficient algorithm to map each vertex to its respective tree root in a forest of trees
Input here is a text file with containing edges of the form 'u v' where u -> v is the edge of a tree in the forest. Root of particular tree is the form 'u u'.
Output will have each vertex pointed to its respective root.
This code was tested and benchmarked on UB's HPC center, Center for Computational Research.
